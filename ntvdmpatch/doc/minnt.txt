About MinNT
===========
Stephanos Ioannidis, who thankfully gave us the build environment for NT
and the OpenNT project also created a NT build system that just features a 
minimal NT core to build Project in the subtree of NT, which has the following
advantages over the original NT build system

 * It contains a more recent NTVDM sourcecode version!
 * It also operates on newer Windows Versions than XP, thus it can be used
   for building on the target machine
 * The newer source is multilingual and allows you building non-English
   NTVDM versions

As there are significant advantages in using this build system, I made some
patches for it to actually get it working with NTVDMx64.
As it lacks some libraries/headers, you still need the old NT4 sourcecode
to pull in some required dependencies.

Requirements
============
 * MinNT repository with NTVDM with latest commits as of Apr 16, 2017 
   (q160765803-minint4-85fac4faadc7 or more specifically 
    MinNT-20170416-85fac4faadc77203db8ddc66af280a75c1b717b0.zip)
   opennt.net site contains some hints on where to find it.
 * Windows NT4 repository old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z
   (a.k.a. old-src-sr687.7z)
 * Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0 
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800
 * Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 (ISO) 
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442

 * An installed version of 7-zip file manager
   https://www.7-zip.de


Setup MINNT build environment
=============================

Please ensure that your build root is in a directory with a very short path 
length, otherwise the build process will fail.
So i.e. C:\WORK
Also make sure, that the path name you choose does not contain any spaces.
Alternatively, map the build root to a seperate drive letter, i.e. W: with
subst W: .

1) Place the following directories in your build directory:

 * Extract NTOSBE-master
 * Create minnt directory and extract contents of minnt (q160765803-minint4-85fac4faadc7) to it
 * Extract our ntvdmpatch repository 

You now have:

  minnt
    base
    ds
    ...
  NTOSBE-master
    doc
    profiles
    ...
  ntvdmpatch
    doc
    experimental
    ...

2) Download required SDK ISOs and old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z and place them in
   ntvdmpatch\minnt\work

 * https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800
 * https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442
 * Google old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z or old-src-sr687.7z

You now have in ntvdmpatch\minnt\work:

  GRMSDK_EN_DVD.iso
  GRMWDK_EN_7600_1.ISO
  old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z

3) Run ntvdmpatch\minnt\prepare.cmd
   minntfix directory will now be prepared with the missing files that need to be 
   added to minnt but cannot be supplied by me due to legal reasons.

4) Run ntvdmpatch\minnt\patch.cmd
   to create a working minnt repository

5) Run ntvdmpatch\minnt\mktools.cmd
   to prepare the build environment tools

6) Run NTOSBE-master\sizzle_minnt.cmd
   to open build shell

7) Run buildrepoidw.cmd -y
   on OpenNT shell

Patch and compile
=================

8) cd %NTROOT%\..\ntvdmpatch
   patch.cmd

9) cd %NTROOT%\..\ntvdmpatch
   bld-minnt.cmd 

In case you have to update ntvdmpatch after you once prepared the
repository like mentioned before, it's usually enough to delete 
minnt\base\mvdm directory, reextract it from minnt zip file and then 
do steps 4, 6-9

Create release
==============
9) Depending on the language you want to use, you can use the language
   as a parameter to the mkrelease-minnt command:

   cd %NTROOT%\..\ntvdmpatch
   mkrelease-minnt

If you do not supply a language parameter, release for all languages is built.
Language codes available:
br	-	Brazilian
chs	-	Chinese
cht	-	Taiwanese
cs	-	Czech
es	-	Spanish
fr	-	French
GER	-	German
hu	-	Hungarian
it	-	Italian
JPN	-	Japanese
KOR	-	Korean
nl	-	Dutch
pl	-	Polish
pt	-	Portuguese
ru	-	Russian
sv	-	Swedish

The result is built in newly created releases\ directory where you have
one release-folder per language that you can use.
